# SimpleFactory

This factory can create objects depending on an input parameter. It is used to instantiate objects on demand. 
Sometimes, we want to create objects depending on an input parameter or simply we have a group of objects whose 
creation algorithm is complex. In those cases, a `Factory` can help to handle the creation of every object. 

In this example, we want to create a robot depending of its type. In addition, we want the Factory to handle a 
unique ID per robot. Of course this could be handled in the main function, however it is better to let the Factory
take care of the creation of the robot and the uniqueness of the ID.
